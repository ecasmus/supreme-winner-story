Deep in the woods there lived a bear who was very hungry. His name was Steve
and he liked to eat honey. One day he ventured out of his home in order
to find some. He crossed a river, turned left at the big red maple, and finally
found the honey store.
He went into the store and asked for the store Manager if they had fresh honey
right now. The manager said yes and told Steve that he had to promise him a
request then he could sell him the honey. Then Steve asked him what kind of 
request. The manager told him he should allow others to call him Winnie. 

Steve wasn't the biggest fan of the idea and instead opted to only allow 
people to only call him Steve. The store manager told Steve that he wouldn't
sell Steve honey. Steve asked the store owner if there was a problem as he 
stood up fully.

"Sir, this is a Wendy's," said the the manager. But it was too late. Rage 
overcame Steve, and he cracked his knuckles and made a fist. Drops of sweat
fell from the manager's face as he reached for his phone, preparing to call
the police.

"I am FED UP WITH YOUR LOUSY SERVICE!" Steve swung his fist, which he hurled
... towards his pocket? And now ... he grabbed his phone? The manager caught
a small glimpse of what he was furiously typing. Yes, yes, that was indeed his
blog. He was ranting on his blog.

As Steve paced out of the store, the manager breathed a disappointed sigh. 
"Doesn't he know what Costco is?"
