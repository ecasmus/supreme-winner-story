Deep in the woods there lived a bear who was very hungry. His name was Steve
and he liked to eat honey. One day he ventured out of his home in order
to find some. He crossed a river, turned left at the big red maple, and finally
found the honey store.
He went into the store and asked for the store Manager if they had fresh honey
right now. The manager said yes and told Steve that he had to promise him a
request then he could sell him the honey. Then Steve asked him what kind of 
request. The manager told him he should allow others to call him Winnie.
